    "machine learning, particularly supervised learning, between the\n",
    "complexity of a model and the amount of training data needed to train\n",
    "it.  Since data is often limited, in practice it is often useful to\n",
    "use a less-complex model with higher bias, that is  a model whose asymptotic\n",
    "performance is worse than another model because it is easier to\n",
    "train and less sensitive to sampling noise arising from having a\n",
    "finite-sized training dataset (smaller variance). \n",
    "\n",
    "The above equations tell us that in\n",
    "order to minimize the expected test error, we need to select a\n",
    "statistical learning method that simultaneously achieves low variance\n",
    "and low bias. Note that variance is inherently a nonnegative quantity,\n",
    "and squared bias is also nonnegative. Hence, we see that the expected\n",
    "test MSE can never lie below $Var(\\epsilon)$, the irreducible error.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do we mean by the variance and bias of a statistical learning\n",
    "method? The variance refers to the amount by which our model would change if we\n",
    "estimated it using a different training data set. Since the training\n",
    "data are used to fit the statistical learning method, different\n",
    "training data sets  will result in a different estimate. But ideally the\n",
    "estimate for our model should not vary too much between training\n",
    "sets. However, if a method has high variance  then small changes in\n",
    "the training data can result in large changes in the model. In general, more\n",
    "flexible statistical methods have higher variance.\n",
