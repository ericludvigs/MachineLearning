!split
===== Bagging =====

The _plain_ decision trees suffer from high
variance. This means that if we split the training data into two parts
at random, and fit a decision tree to both halves, the results that we
get could be quite different. In contrast, a procedure with low
variance will yield similar results if applied repeatedly to distinct
data sets; linear regression tends to have low variance, if the ratio
of $n$ to $p$ is moderately large. 

_Bootstrap aggregation_, or just _bagging_, is a
general-purpose procedure for reducing the variance of a statistical
learning method. 


!split
===== More bagging =====

Bagging typically results in improved accuracy
over prediction using a single tree. Unfortunately, however, it can be
difficult to interpret the resulting model. Recall that one of the
advantages of decision trees is the attractive and easily interpreted
diagram that results.

However, when we bag a large number of trees, it is no longer
possible to represent the resulting statistical learning procedure
using a single tree, and it is no longer clear which variables are
most important to the procedure. Thus, bagging improves prediction
accuracy at the expense of interpretability.  Although the collection
of bagged trees is much more difficult to interpret than a single
tree, one can obtain an overall summary of the importance of each
predictor using the MSE (for bagging regression trees) or the Gini
index (for bagging classification trees). In the case of bagging
regression trees, we can record the total amount that the MSE is
decreased due to splits over a given predictor, averaged over all $B$ possible
trees. A large value indicates an important predictor. Similarly, in
the context of bagging classification trees, we can add up the total
amount that the Gini index  is decreased by splits over a given
predictor, averaged over all $B$ trees.



!split
=====  Making your own Bootstrap: Changing the Level of the Decision Tree =====

Let us bring up our good old boostrap example from the linear regression lectures. We change the linerar regression algorithm with
a decision tree wth different depths and perform a bootstrap aggregate (in this case we perform as many bootstraps as data points $n$).

!split
===== Random forests =====

Random forests provide an improvement over bagged trees by way of a
small tweak that decorrelates the trees. 

As in bagging, we build a
number of decision trees on bootstrapped training samples. But when
building these decision trees, each time a split in a tree is
considered, a random sample of $m$ predictors is chosen as split
candidates from the full set of $p$ predictors. The split is allowed to
use only one of those $m$ predictors. 

A fresh sample of $m$ predictors is
taken at each split, and typically we choose 

!bt
\[
m\approx \sqrt{p}.
\]
!et

In building a random forest, at
each split in the tree, the algorithm is not even allowed to consider
a majority of the available predictors. 

The reason for this is rather clever. Suppose that there is one very
strong predictor in the data set, along with a number of other
moderately strong predictors. Then in the collection of bagged
variable importance random forest trees, most or all of the trees will
use this strong predictor in the top split. Consequently, all of the
bagged trees will look quite similar to each other. Hence the
predictions from the bagged trees will be highly correlated.
Unfortunately, averaging many highly correlated quantities does not
lead to as large of a reduction in variance as averaging many
uncorrelated quantities. In particular, this means that bagging will
not lead to a substantial reduction in variance over a single tree in
this setting.


!split
===== Random Forest Algorithm =====
The algorithm described here can be applied to both classification and regression problems.

We will grow of forest of say $B$ trees.
o For $b=1:B$
  * Draw a bootstrap sample from the training data organized in our $\bm{X}$ matrix.
  * We grow then a random forest tree $T_b$ based on the bootstrapped data by repeating the steps outlined till we reach the maximum node size is reached
    o we select $m \le p$ variables at random from the $p$ predictors/features
    o pick the best split point among the $m$ features using for example the CART algorithm and create a new node
    o split the node into daughter nodes
o Output then the ensemble of trees $\{T_b\}_1^{B}$ and make predictions for either a regression type of problem or a classification type of problem.

Recall that the cumulative gains curve shows the percentage of the
overall number of cases in a given category *gained* by targeting a
percentage of the total number of cases.

Similarly, the receiver operating characteristic curve, or ROC curve,
displays the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its
discrimination threshold is varied. It plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate.

!split
===== Boosting, a Bird's Eye View =====

The basic idea is to combine weak classifiers in order to create a good
classifier. With a weak classifier we often intend a classifier which
produces results which are only slightly better than we would get by
random guesses.

This is done by applying in an iterative way a weak (or a standard
classifier like decision trees) to modify the data. In each iteration
we emphasize those observations which are misclassified by weighting
them with a factor.


!split
===== What is boosting? Additive Modelling/Iterative Fitting =====

Boosting is a way of fitting an additive expansion in a set of
elementary basis functions like for example some simple polynomials.
Assume for example that we have a function
!bt
\[
f_M(x) = \sum_{i=1}^M \beta_m b(x;\gamma_m),
\]
!et

where $\beta_m$ are the expansion parameters to be determined in a
minimization process and $b(x;\gamma_m)$ are some simple functions of
the multivariable parameter $x$ which is characterized by the
parameters $\gamma_m$.

As an example, consider the Sigmoid function we used in logistic
regression. In that case, we can translate the function
$b(x;\gamma_m)$ into the Sigmoid function


!bt
\[
\sigma(t) = \frac{1}{1+\exp{(-t)}},
\]
!et

where $t=\gamma_0+\gamma_1 x$ and the parameters $\gamma_0$ and
$\gamma_1$ were determined by the Logistic Regression fitting
algorithm.

As another example, consider the cost function we defined for linear regression
!bt
\[
C(\bm{y},\bm{f}) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(y_i-f(x_i))^2.
\]
!et

In this case the function $f(x)$ was replaced by the design matrix
$\bm{X}$ and the unknown linear regression parameters $\bm{\beta}$,
that is $\bm{f}=\bm{X}\bm{\beta}$. In linear regression we can 
simply invert a matrix and obtain the parameters $\beta$ by

!bt
\[
\bm{\beta}=\left(\bm{X}^T\bm{X}\right)^{-1}\bm{X}^T\bm{y}.
\]
!et

In iterative fitting or additive modeling, we minimize the cost function with respect to the parameters $\beta_m$ and $\gamma_m$.


!split
===== Iterative Fitting, Regression and Squared-error Cost Function =====

The way we proceed is as follows (here we specialize to the squared-error cost function)

o Establish a cost function, here ${\cal C}(\bm{y},\bm{f}) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(y_i-f_M(x_i))^2$ with $f_M(x) = \sum_{i=1}^M \beta_m b(x;\gamma_m)$.
o Initialize with a guess $f_0(x)$. It could be one or even zero or some random numbers.
o For $m=1:M$
  o minimize $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(y_i-f_{m-1}(x_i)-\beta b(x;\gamma))^2$ wrt $\gamma$ and $\beta$
  o This gives the optimal values $\beta_m$ and $\gamma_m$
  o Determine then the new values $f_m(x)=f_{m-1}(x) +\beta_m b(x;\gamma_m)$

We could use any of the algorithms we have discussed till now. If we
use trees, $\gamma$ parameterizes the split variables and split points
at the internal nodes, and the predictions at the terminal nodes.


!split
===== Squared-Error Example and Iterative Fitting =====

To better understand what happens, let us develop the steps for the iterative fitting using the above squared error function.

For simplicity we assume also that our functions $b(x;\gamma)=1+\gamma x$. 

This means that for every iteration $m$, we need to optimize

!bt
\[
(\beta_m,\gamma_m) = \mathrm{argmin}_{\beta,\lambda}\hspace{0.1cm} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(y_i-f_{m-1}(x_i)-\beta b(x;\gamma))^2=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(y_i-f_{m-1}(x_i)-\beta(1+\gamma x_i))^2.
\]
!et

We start our iteration by simply setting $f_0(x)=0$. 
Taking the derivatives  with respect to $\beta$ and $\gamma$ we obtain
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial {\cal C}}{\partial \beta} = -2\sum_{i}(1+\gamma x_i)(y_i-\beta(1+\gamma x_i))=0,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial {\cal C}}{\partial \gamma} =-2\sum_{i}\beta x_i(y_i-\beta(1+\gamma x_i))=0.
\]
!et
We can then rewrite these equations as (defining $\bm{w}=\bm{e}+\gamma \bm{x})$ with $\bm{e}$ being the unit vector)
!bt
\[
\gamma \bm{w}^T(\bm{y}-\beta\gamma \bm{w})=0,
\]
!et
which gives us $\beta = \bm{w}^T\bm{y}/(\bm{w}^T\bm{w})$. Similarly we have 
!bt
\[
\beta\gamma \bm{x}^T(\bm{y}-\beta(1+\gamma \bm{x}))=0,
\]
!et

which leads to $\gamma =(\bm{x}^T\bm{y}-\beta\bm{x}^T\bm{e})/(\beta\bm{x}^T\bm{x})$.  Inserting
for $\beta$ gives us an equation for $\gamma$. This is a non-linear equation in the unknown $\gamma$ and has to be solved numerically. 

The solution to these two equations gives us in turn $\beta_1$ and $\gamma_1$ leading to the new expression for $f_1(x)$ as
$f_1(x) = \beta_1(1+\gamma_1x)$. Doing this $M$ times results in our final estimate for the function $f$. 



!split
===== Iterative Fitting, Classification and AdaBoost =====

Let us consider a binary classification problem with two outcomes $y_i \in \{-1,1\}$ and $i=0,1,2,\dots,n-1$ as our set of
observations. We define a classification function $G(x)$ which produces a prediction taking one or the other of the two values 
$\{-1,1\}$.

The error rate of the training sample is then

!bt
\[
\mathrm{\overline{err}}=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} I(y_i\ne G(x_i)). 
\]
!et

The iterative procedure starts with defining a weak classifier whose
error rate is barely better than random guessing.  The iterative
procedure in boosting is to sequentially apply a  weak
classification algorithm to repeatedly modified versions of the data
producing a sequence of weak classifiers $G_m(x)$.

Here we will express our  function $f(x)$ in terms of $G(x)$. That is
!bt
\[
f_M(x) = \sum_{i=1}^M \beta_m b(x;\gamma_m),
\]
!et
will be a function of 
!bt
\[
G_M(x) = \mathrm{sign} \sum_{i=1}^M \alpha_m G_m(x).
\]
!et



!split
===== Adaptive Boosting, AdaBoost =====

In our iterative procedure we define thus
!bt
\[
f_m(x) = f_{m-1}(x)+\beta_mG_m(x).
\]
!et

The simplest possible cost function which leads (also simple from a computational point of view) to the AdaBoost algorithm is the
exponential cost/loss function defined as
!bt
\[
C(\bm{y},\bm{f}) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\exp{(-y_i(f_{m-1}(x_i)+\beta G(x_i))}.
\]
!et

We optimize $\beta$ and $G$ for each value of $m=1:M$ as we did in the regression case.
This is normally done in two steps. Let us however first rewrite the cost function as 

!bt
\[
C(\bm{y},\bm{f}) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}w_i^{m}\exp{(-y_i\beta G(x_i))},
\]
!et
where we have defined $w_i^m= \exp{(-y_if_{m-1}(x_i))}$.

!split
===== Building up AdaBoost =====

First, for any $\beta > 0$, we optimize $G$ by setting
!bt
\[
G_m(x) = \mathrm{sign} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} w_i^m I(y_i \ne G_(x_i)),
\]
!et
which is the classifier that minimizes the weighted error rate in predicting $y$.

We can do this by rewriting
!bt
\[
\exp{-(\beta)}\sum_{y_i=G(x_i)}w_i^m+\exp{(\beta)}\sum_{y_i\ne G(x_i)}w_i^m,
\]
!et
which can be rewritten as
!bt
\[
(\exp{(\beta)}-\exp{-(\beta)})\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}w_i^mI(y_i\ne G(x_i))+\exp{(-\beta)}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}w_i^m=0,
\]
!et
which leads to
!bt
\[
\beta_m = \frac{1}{2}\log{\frac{1-\mathrm{\overline{err}}}{\mathrm{\overline{err}}}},
\]
!et
where we have redefined the error as 
!bt
\[
\mathrm{\overline{err}}_m=\frac{1}{n}\frac{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}w_i^mI(y_i\ne G(x_i)}{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}w_i^m},
\]
!et
which leads to an update of
!bt
\[
f_m(x) = f_{m-1}(x) +\beta_m G_m(x).
\]
!et
This leads to the new weights
!bt
\[
w_i^{m+1} = w_i^m \exp{(-y_i\beta_m G_m(x_i))}
\]
!et


!split
===== Adaptive boosting: AdaBoost, Basic Algorithm =====

The algorithm here is rather straightforward. Assume that our weak
classifier is a decision tree and we consider a binary set of outputs
with $y_i \in \{-1,1\}$ and $i=0,1,2,\dots,n-1$ as our set of
observations. Our design matrix is given in terms of the
feature/predictor vectors
$\bm{X}=[\bm{x}_0\bm{x}_1\dots\bm{x}_{p-1}]$. Finally, we define also a
classifier determined by our data via a function $G(x)$. This function tells us how well we are able to classify our outputs/targets $\bm{y}$. 

We have already defined the misclassification error $\mathrm{err}$ as
!bt
\[
\mathrm{err}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}I(y_i\ne G(x_i)),
\]
!et
where the function $I()$ is one if we misclassify and zero if we classify correctly. 

!split
===== Basic Steps of AdaBoost =====

With the above definitions we are now ready to set up the algorithm for AdaBoost.
The basic idea is to set up weights which will be used to scale the correctly classified and the misclassified cases.
o We start by initializing all weights to $w_i = 1/n$, with $i=0,1,2,\dots n-1$. It is easy to see that we must have $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}w_i = 1$.
o We rewrite the misclassification error as 
!bt
\[
\mathrm{\overline{err}}_m=\frac{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}w_i^m I(y_i\ne G(x_i))}{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}w_i},
\]
!et
o Then we start looping over all attempts at classifying, namely we start an iterative process for $m=1:M$, where $M$ is the final number of classifications. Our given classifier could for example be a plain decision tree.
  o Fit then a given classifier to the training set using the weights $w_i$.
  o Compute then $\mathrm{err}$ and figure out which events are classified properly and which are classified wrongly.
  o Define a quantity $\alpha_{m} = \log{(1-\mathrm{\overline{err}}_m)/\mathrm{\overline{err}}_m}$
  o Set the new weights to $w_i = w_i\times \exp{(\alpha_m I(y_i\ne G(x_i)}$.
o Compute the new classifier $G(x)= \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\alpha_m I(y_i\ne G(x_i)$.

For the iterations with $m \le 2$ the weights are modified
individually at each steps. The observations which were misclassified
at iteration $m-1$ have a weight which is larger than those which were
classified properly. As this proceeds, the observations which were
difficult to classifiy correctly are given a larger influence. Each
new classification step $m$ is then forced to concentrate on those
observations that are missed in the previous iterations.

===== AdaBoost Examples =====

!split
===== Gradient boosting: Basics with Steepest Descent/Functional Gradient Descent =====

Gradient boosting is again a similar technique to Adaptive boosting,
it combines so-called weak classifiers or regressors into a strong
method via a series of iterations.

In order to understand the method, let us illustrate its basics by
bringing back the essential steps in linear regression, where our cost
function was the least squares function.

!split
===== The Squared-Error again! Steepest Descent =====

We start again with our cost function ${\cal C}(\bm{y}m\bm{f})=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}{\cal L}(y_i, f(x_i))$ where we want to minimize
This means that for every iteration, we need to optimize

!bt
\[
(\hat{\bm{f}}) = \mathrm{argmin}_{\bm{f}}\hspace{0.1cm} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(y_i-f(x_i))^2.
\]
!et

We define a real function $h_m(x)$ that defines our final function $f_M(x)$ as
!bt
\[
f_M(x) = \sum_{m=0}^M h_m(x).
\]
!et

In the steepest decent approach we approximate $h_m(x) = -\rho_m g_m(x)$, where $\rho_m$ is a scalar and $g_m(x)$ the gradient defined as
!bt
\[
g_m(x_i) = \left[ \frac{\partial {\cal L}(y_i, f(x_i))}{\partial f(x_i)}\right]_{f(x_i)=f_{m-1}(x_i)}.
\]
!et

With the new gradient we can update $f_m(x) = f_{m-1}(x) -\rho_m g_m(x)$. Using the above squared-error function we see that
the gradient is $g_m(x_i) = -2(y_i-f(x_i))$.

Choosing $f_0(x)=0$ we obtain $g_m(x) = -2y_i$ and inserting this into the minimization problem for the cost function we have
!bt
\[
(\rho_1) = \mathrm{argmin}_{\rho}\hspace{0.1cm} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(y_i+2\rho y_i)^2.
\]
!et

!split
===== Steepest Descent Example =====

Optimizing with respect to $\rho$ we obtain (taking the derivative) that $\rho_1 = -1/2$. We have then that
!bt
\[
f_1(x) = f_{0}(x) -\rho_1 g_1(x)=-y_i.
\]
!et
We can then proceed and compute
!bt
\[
g_2(x_i) = \left[ \frac{\partial {\cal L}(y_i, f(x_i))}{\partial f(x_i)}\right]_{f(x_i)=f_{1}(x_i)=y_i}=-4y_i,
\]
!et
and find a new value for $\rho_2=-1/2$ and continue till we have reached $m=M$. We can modify the steepest descent method, or steepest boosting, by introducing what is called _gradient boosting_. 

!split
===== Gradient Boosting, algorithm =====

Steepest descent is however not much used, since it only optimizes $f$ at a fixed set of $n$ points,
so we do not learn a function that can generalize. However, we can modify the algorithm by
fitting a weak learner to approximate the negative gradient signal. 

Suppose we have a cost function $C(f)=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}L(y_i, f(x_i))$ where $y_i$ is our target and $f(x_i)$ the function which is meant to model $y_i$. The above cost function could be our standard  squared-error  function
!bt
\[
C(\bm{y},\bm{f})=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(y_i-f(x_i))^2.
\]
!et

The way we proceed in an iterative fashion is to
o Initialize our estimate $f_0(x)$.
o For $m=1:M$, we
  o compute the negative gradient vector $\bm{u}_m = -\partial C(\bm{y},\bm{f})/\partial \bm{f}(x)$ at $f(x) = f_{m-1}(x)$;
  o fit the so-called base-learner to the negative gradient $h_m(u_m,x)$;
  o update the estimate $f_m(x) = f_{m-1}(x)+h_m(u_m,x)$;
o The final estimate is then $f_M(x) = \sum_{m=1}^M h_m(u_m,x)$.

"XGBoost":"https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost" or Extreme Gradient
Boosting, is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library
designed to be highly efficient, flexible and portable. It implements
machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting
framework. XGBoost provides a parallel tree boosting that solve many

!split
=====  What is the link between Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and some general Remarks =====

Artificial intelligence is built upon integrated machine learning
algorithms as discussed in this course, which in turn are fundamentally rooted in optimization and
statistical learning.

Can we have Artificial Intelligence without Machine Learning? See "this post for inspiration":"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-artificial-intelligence-without-machine-learning-claudia-pohlink".

!split
===== Going back to the beginning of the semester =====

Traditionally the field of machine learning has had its main focus on
predictions and correlations.  These concepts outline in some sense
the difference between machine learning and what is normally called
Bayesian statistics or Bayesian inference.

In machine learning and prediction based tasks, we are often
interested in developing algorithms that are capable of learning
patterns from given data in an automated fashion, and then using these
learned patterns to make predictions or assessments of newly given
data. In many cases, our primary concern is the quality of the
predictions or assessments, and we are less concerned with the
underlying patterns that were learned in order to make these
predictions.  This leads to what normally has been labeled as a
frequentist approach.

!split
===== Not so sharp distinctions =====

You should keep in mind that the division between a traditional
frequentist approach with focus on predictions and correlations only
and a Bayesian approach with an emphasis on estimations and
causations, is not that sharp. Machine learning can be frequentist
with ensemble methods (EMB) as examples and Bayesian with Gaussian
Processes as examples.

If one views ML from a statistical learning
perspective, one is then equally interested in estimating errors as
one is in finding correlations and making predictions. It is important
to keep in mind that the frequentist and Bayesian approaches differ
mainly in their interpretations of probability. In the frequentist
world, we can only assign probabilities to repeated random
phenomena. From the observations of these phenomena, we can infer the
probability of occurrence of a specific event.  In Bayesian
statistics, we assign probabilities to specific events and the
probability represents the measure of belief/confidence for that
event. The belief can be updated in the light of new evidence.

===== Perspective on Machine Learning =====

o Rapidly emerging application area
o Experiment AND theory are evolving in many many fields. Still many low-hanging fruits.
o Requires education/retraining for more widespread adoption

Huge amounts of data sets require automation, classical analysis tools often inadequate. 
High energy physics hit this wall in the 90’s.
In 2009 single top quark production was determined via "Boosted decision trees, Bayesian
Neural Networks, etc.":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/0903.0850.pdf". Similarly, the search for Higgs was a statistical learning tour de force. See this link on "Kaggle.com":"https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson".

===== What's the future like?  =====

Based on multi-layer nonlinear neural networks, deep learning can
learn directly from raw data, automatically extract and abstract
features from layer to layer, and then achieve the goal of regression,
classification, or ranking. Deep learning has made breakthroughs in
computer vision, speech processing and natural language, and reached
or even surpassed human level. The success of deep learning is mainly
due to the three factors: big data, big model, and big computing.

In the past few decades, many different architectures of deep neural
networks have been proposed, such as
o Convolutional neural networks, which are mostly used in image and video data processing, and have also been applied to sequential data such as text processing;
o Recurrent neural networks, which can process sequential data of variable length and have been widely used in natural language understanding and speech processing;
o Encoder-decoder framework, which is mostly used for image or sequence generation, such as machine translation, text summarization, and image captioning.
o _Generative deep learning_! Recent textbook by David Foster (and obviously many other ones) at URL:"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/generative-deep-learning/9781492041931/""
!split
===== Types of Machine Learning, a repetition =====

!bblock
The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into two main categories. 
In *supervised learning* we know the answer to a problem,
and let the computer deduce the logic behind it. On the other hand, *unsupervised learning*
is a method for finding patterns and relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.
Some authours also operate with a third category, namely *reinforcement learning*. This is a paradigm 
of learning inspired by behavioural psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error, 
solely from rewards and punishment.

Another way to categorize machine learning tasks is to consider the desired output of a system.
Some of the most common tasks are:

  * Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification is typically supervised learning.

  * Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.

  * Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.

  * Other unsupervised learning algortihms like _Boltzmann machines_
!eblock


!split
===== Why Boltzmann machines? =====

What is known as restricted Boltzmann Machines (RMB) have received a lot of attention lately. 
One of the major reasons is that they can be stacked layer-wise to build deep neural networks that capture complicated statistics.

The original RBMs had just one visible layer and a hidden layer, but recently so-called Gaussian-binary RBMs have gained quite some popularity in imaging since they are capable of modeling continuous data that are common to natural images. 

Furthermore, they have been used to solve complicated "quantum mechanical many-particle problems or classical statistical physics problems like the Ising and Potts classes of models":"https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.91.045002". 


!split
===== Boltzmann Machines =====

Why use a generative model rather than the more well known discriminative deep neural networks (DNN)?  _Simplest approach to generative deep learning_.

* Discriminitave methods have several limitations: They are mainly supervised learning methods, thus requiring labeled data. And there are tasks they cannot accomplish, like drawing new examples from an unknown probability distribution.

* A generative model can learn to represent and sample from a probability distribution. The core idea is to learn a parametric model of the probability distribution from which the training data was drawn. As an example

  o A model for images could learn to draw new examples of cats and dogs, given a training dataset of images of cats and dogs.
  o Generate a sample of an ordered or disordered phase, having been given samples of such phases.
  o Model the trial function for "Monte Carlo calculations":"https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.91.045002".


!split
===== Some similarities and differences from DNNs =====

 o Both use gradient-descent based learning procedures for minimizing cost functions
 o Energy based models don't use backpropagation and automatic differentiation for computing gradients, instead turning to Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods.
 o DNNs often have several hidden layers. A restricted Boltzmann machine has only one hidden layer, however several RBMs can be stacked to make up Deep Belief Networks, of which they constitute the building blocks.

History: The RBM was developed by amongst others "Geoffrey Hinton":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hinton", called by some the "Godfather of Deep Learning", working with the University of Toronto and Google.


!split
=====  Boltzmann machines (BM) =====

!bblock
A BM is what we would call an undirected probabilistic graphical model
with stochastic continuous or discrete units.
!eblock
!bblock
It is interpreted as a stochastic recurrent neural network where the
state of each unit(neurons/nodes) depends on the units it is connected
to. The weights in the network represent thus the strength of the
interaction between various units/nodes.
!eblock
!bblock
It turns into a Hopfield network if we choose deterministic rather
than stochastic units. In contrast to a Hopfield network, a BM is a
so-called generative model. It allows us to generate new samples from
the learned distribution.
!eblock

!split
===== A standard BM setup =====

!bblock
A standard BM network is divided into a set of observable and visible units $\hat{x}$ and a set of unknown hidden units/nodes $\hat{h}$.
!eblock

!bblock
Additionally there can be bias nodes for the hidden and visible layers. These biases are normally set to $1$.
!eblock

!bblock
BMs are stackable, meaning they cwe can train a BM which serves as input to another BM. We can construct deep networks for learning complex PDFs. The layers can be trained one after another, a feature which makes them popular in deep learning
!eblock

However, they are often hard to train. This leads to the introduction of so-called restricted BMs, or RBMS.
Here we take away all lateral connections between nodes in the visible layer as well as connections between nodes in the hidden layer. The network is illustrated in the figure below.



!split
===== The structure of the RBM network =====

FIGURE: [figures/RBM.pdf, width=800 frac=1.0]



!split
===== The network =====

_The network layers_:
  o A function $\mathbf{x}$ that represents the visible layer, a vector of $M$ elements (nodes). This layer represents both what the RBM might be given as training input, and what we want it to be able to reconstruct. This might for example be given by the pixels of an image or coefficients representing speech, or the coordinates of a quantum mechanical state function.
  o The function $\mathbf{h}$ represents the hidden, or latent, layer. A vector of $N$ elements (nodes). Also called "feature detectors".

!split
===== Goals =====

The goal of the hidden layer is to increase the model's expressive
power. We encode complex interactions between visible variables by
introducing additional, hidden variables that interact with visible
degrees of freedom in a simple manner, yet still reproduce the complex
correlations between visible degrees in the data once marginalized
over (integrated out).

_The network parameters, to be optimized/learned_:
  o $\mathbf{a}$ represents the visible bias, a vector of same length as $\mathbf{x}$.
  o $\mathbf{b}$ represents the hidden bias, a vector of same lenght as $\mathbf{h}$.
  o $W$ represents the interaction weights, a matrix of size $M\times N$.

===== Joint distribution =====

The restricted Boltzmann machine is described by a Boltzmann distribution

	P_{rbm}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{h}) = \frac{1}{Z} e^{-\frac{1}{T_0}E(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{h})},

where $Z$ is the normalization constant or partition function, defined as

\begin{align}
	Z = \int \int e^{-\frac{1}{T_0}E(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{h})} d\mathbf{x} d\mathbf{h}.

===== Network Elements, the energy function  =====

The function $E(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{h})$ gives the _energy_ of a
configuration (pair of vectors) $(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{h})$. The lower
the energy of a configuration, the higher the probability of it. This
function also depends on the parameters $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$ and
$W$. Thus, when we adjust them during the learning procedure, we are
adjusting the energy function to best fit our problem.

An expression for the energy function is
!bt
\[
E(\hat{x},\hat{h}) = -\sum_{ia}^{NA}b_i^a \alpha_i^a(x_i)-\sum_{jd}^{MD}c_j^d \beta_j^d(h_j)-\sum_{ijad}^{NAMD}b_i^a \alpha_i^a(x_i)c_j^d \beta_j^d(h_j)w_{ij}^{ad}.
\]
!et

Here $\beta_j^d(h_j)$ and $\alpha_i^a(x_j)$ are so-called transfer functions that map a given input value to a desired feature value. The labels $a$ and $d$ denote that there can be multiple transfer functions per variable. The first sum depends only on the visible units. The second on the hidden ones. _Note_ that there is no connection between nodes in a layer.

The quantities $b$ and $c$ can be interpreted as the visible and hidden biases, respectively.

The connection between the nodes in the two layers is given by the weights $w_{ij}$. 

!split
===== Defining different types of RBMs =====
There are different variants of RBMs, and the differences lie in the types of visible and hidden units we choose as well as in the implementation of the energy function $E(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{h})$. 

!bblock Binary-Binary RBM:

RBMs were first developed using binary units in both the visible and hidden layer. The corresponding energy function is defined as follows:
!bt
\begin{align}
	E(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{h}) = - \sum_i^M x_i a_i- \sum_j^N b_j h_j - \sum_{i,j}^{M,N} x_i w_{ij} h_j,
\end{align}
!et
where the binary values taken on by the nodes are most commonly 0 and 1.
!eblock
!bblock Gaussian-Binary RBM:

Another varient is the RBM where the visible units are Gaussian while the hidden units remain binary:
!bt
\begin{align}
	E(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{h}) = \sum_i^M \frac{(x_i - a_i)^2}{2\sigma_i^2} - \sum_j^N b_j h_j - \sum_{i,j}^{M,N} \frac{x_i w_{ij} h_j}{\sigma_i^2}. 
\end{align}
!et
!eblock

!split
===== More about RBMs =====
o Useful when we model continuous data (i.e., we wish $\mathbf{x}$ to be continuous)
o Requires a smaller learning rate, since there's no upper bound to the value a component might take in the reconstruction

Other types of units include:
 o Softmax and multinomial units
 o Gaussian visible and hidden units
 o Binomial units
 o Rectified linear units

!split
===== Autoencoders: Overarching view =====

Autoencoders are artificial neural networks capable of learning
efficient representations of the input data (these representations are called codings)  without
any supervision (i.e., the training set is unlabeled). These codings
typically have a much lower dimensionality than the input data, making
autoencoders useful for dimensionality reduction. 

More importantly, autoencoders act as powerful feature detectors, and
they can be used for unsupervised pretraining of deep neural networks.

Lastly, they are capable of randomly generating new data that looks
very similar to the training data; this is called a generative
model. For example, you could train an autoencoder on pictures of
faces, and it would then be able to generate new faces.  Surprisingly,
autoencoders work by simply learning to copy their inputs to their
outputs. This may sound like a trivial task, but we will see that
constraining the network in various ways can make it rather
difficult. For example, you can limit the size of the internal
representation, or you can add noise to the inputs and train the
network to recover the original inputs. These constraints prevent the
autoencoder from trivially copying the inputs directly to the outputs,
which forces it to learn efficient ways of representing the data. In
short, the codings are byproducts of the autoencoder’s attempt to
learn the identity function under some constraints.

=====  Bayesian Machine Learning =====

This is an important topic if we aim at extracting a probability
distribution. This gives us also a confidence interval and error
estimates.

Bayesian machine learning allows us to encode our prior beliefs about
what those models should look like, independent of what the data tells
us. This is especially useful when we don’t have a ton of data to
confidently learn our model.

===== Reinforcement Learning =====

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one of the most exciting fields of
Machine Learning today, and also one of the oldest. It has been around
since the 1950s, producing many interesting applications over the
years.

It studies
how agents take actions based on trial and error, so as to maximize
some notion of cumulative reward in a dynamic system or
environment. Due to its generality, the problem has also been studied
in many other disciplines, such as game theory, control theory,
operations research, information theory, multi-agent systems, swarm
intelligence, statistics, and genetic algorithms.

In March 2016, AlphaGo, a computer program that plays the board game
Go, beat Lee Sedol in a five-game match. This was the first time a
computer Go program had beaten a 9-dan (highest rank) professional
without handicaps. AlphaGo is based on deep convolutional neural
networks and reinforcement learning. AlphaGo’s victory was a major
milestone in artificial intelligence and it has also made
reinforcement learning a hot research area in the field of machine
learning.

!split
===== Transfer learning =====

The goal of transfer learning is to transfer the model or knowledge
obtained from a source task to the target task, in order to resolve
the issues of insufficient training data in the target task. The
rationality of doing so lies in that usually the source and target
tasks have inter-correlations, and therefore either the features,
samples, or models in the source task might provide useful information
for us to better solve the target task. Transfer learning is a hot
research topic in recent years, with many problems still waiting to be studied.

!split
===== Adversarial learning =====

The conventional deep generative model has a potential problem: the
model tends to generate extreme instances to maximize the
probabilistic likelihood, which will hurt its performance. Adversarial
learning utilizes the adversarial behaviors (e.g., generating
adversarial instances or training an adversarial model) to enhance the
robustness of the model and improve the quality of the generated
data. In recent years, one of the most promising unsupervised learning
technologies, generative adversarial networks (GAN), has already been
successfully applied to image, speech, and text.

!split
===== Dual learning =====

Dual learning is a new learning paradigm, the basic idea of which is
to use the primal-dual structure between machine learning tasks to
obtain effective feedback/regularization, and guide and strengthen the
learning process, thus reducing the requirement of large-scale labeled
data for deep learning. The idea of dual learning has been applied to
many problems in machine learning, including machine translation,
image style conversion, question answering and generation, image
classification and generation, text classification and generation,
image-to-text, and text-to-image.

!split
===== Distributed machine learning =====

Distributed computation will speed up machine learning algorithms,
significantly improve their efficiency, and thus enlarge their
application. When distributed meets machine learning, more than just
implementing the machine learning algorithms in parallel is required.


!split
===== Meta learning =====

Meta learning is an emerging research direction in machine
learning. Roughly speaking, meta learning concerns learning how to
learn, and focuses on the understanding and adaptation of the learning
itself, instead of just completing a specific learning task. That is,
a meta learner needs to be able to evaluate its own learning methods
and adjust its own learning methods according to specific learning
tasks.

!split
===== The Challenges Facing Machine Learning =====

While there has been much progress in machine learning, there are also challenges.

For example, the mainstream machine learning technologies are
black-box approaches, making us concerned about their potential
risks. To tackle this challenge, we may want to make machine learning
more explainable and controllable. As another example, the
computational complexity of machine learning algorithms is usually
very high and we may want to invent lightweight algorithms or
implementations. Furthermore, in many domains such as physics,
chemistry, biology, and social sciences, people usually seek elegantly
simple equations (e.g., the Schrödinger equation) to uncover the
underlying laws behind various phenomena. In the field of machine
learning, can we reveal simple laws instead of designing more complex
models for data fitting? Although there are many challenges, we are
still very optimistic about the future of machine learning. As we look
forward to the future, here are what we think the research hotspots in
the next ten years will be.

!split
===== Explainable machine learning =====

Machine learning, especially deep learning, evolves rapidly. The
ability gap between machine and human on many complex cognitive tasks
becomes narrower and narrower. However, we are still in the very early
stage in terms of explaining why those effective models work and how
they work.

_What is missing: the gap between correlation and causation_. Standard Machine Learning is based on what e have called a frequentist approach. 

Most
machine learning techniques, especially the statistical ones, depend
highly on correlations in data sets to make predictions and analyses. In
contrast, rational humans tend to reply on clear and trustworthy
causality relations obtained via logical reasoning on real and clear
facts. It is one of the core goals of explainable machine learning to
transition from solving problems by data correlation to solving
problems by logical reasoning.

_Bayesian Machine Learning is one of the exciting research directions in this field_.

===== Scientific Machine Learning =====

An important and emerging field is what has been dubbed as scientific ML, see the article by Deiana et al "Applications and Techniques for Fast Machine Learning in Science, arXiv:2110.13041":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13041"

!bblock

===== Quantum machine learning =====

Quantum machine learning is an emerging interdisciplinary research
area at the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning.

Quantum computers use effects such as quantum coherence and quantum
entanglement to process information, which is fundamentally different
from classical computers. Quantum algorithms have surpassed the best
classical algorithms in several problems (e.g., searching for an
unsorted database, inverting a sparse matrix), which we call quantum
acceleration.

When quantum computing meets machine learning, it can be a mutually
beneficial and reinforcing process, as it allows us to take advantage
of quantum computing to improve the performance of classical machine
learning algorithms. In addition, we can also use the machine learning
algorithms (on classic computers) to analyze and improve quantum
computing systems.

===== Quantum machine learning algorithms based on linear algebra =====

Many quantum machine learning algorithms are based on variants of
quantum algorithms for solving linear equations, which can efficiently
solve N-variable linear equations with complexity of O(log2 N) under
certain conditions. The quantum matrix inversion algorithm can
accelerate many machine learning methods, such as least square linear
regression, least square version of support vector machine, Gaussian
process, and more. The training of these algorithms can be simplified
to solve linear equations. The key bottleneck of this type of quantum
machine learning algorithms is data input—that is, how to initialize
the quantum system with the entire data set. Although efficient
data-input algorithms exist for certain situations, how to efficiently
input data into a quantum system is as yet unknown for most cases.

!split
===== Quantum reinforcement learning =====

In quantum reinforcement learning, a quantum agent interacts with the
classical environment to obtain rewards from the environment, so as to
adjust and improve its behavioral strategies. In some cases, it
achieves quantum acceleration by the quantum processing capabilities
of the agent or the possibility of exploring the environment through
quantum superposition. Such algorithms have been proposed in
superconducting circuits and systems of trapped ions.

!split
===== Quantum deep learning =====

Dedicated quantum information processors, such as quantum annealers
and programmable photonic circuits, are well suited for building deep
quantum networks. The simplest deep quantum network is the Boltzmann
machine. The classical Boltzmann machine consists of bits with tunable
interactions and is trained by adjusting the interaction of these bits
so that the distribution of its expression conforms to the statistics
of the data. To quantize the Boltzmann machine, the neural network can
simply be represented as a set of interacting quantum spins that
correspond to an adjustable Ising model. Then, by initializing the
input neurons in the Boltzmann machine to a fixed state and allowing
the system to heat up, we can read out the output qubits to get the
result.


!split
===== Social machine learning =====

Machine learning aims to imitate how humans
learn. While we have developed successful machine learning algorithms,
until now we have ignored one important fact: humans are social. Each
of us is one part of the total society and it is difficult for us to
live, learn, and improve ourselves, alone and isolated. Therefore, we
should design machines with social properties. Can we let machines
evolve by imitating human society so as to achieve more effective,
intelligent, interpretable “social machine learning”?

And much more.



!split
===== The last words? =====

Early computer scientist Alan Kay said, _The best way to predict the
future is to create it_. Therefore, all machine learning
practitioners, whether scholars or engineers, professors or students,
need to work together to advance these important research
topics. Together, we will not just predict the future, but create it.
